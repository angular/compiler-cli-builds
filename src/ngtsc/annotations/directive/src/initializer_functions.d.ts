/**
 * @fileoverview
 *
 * Angular exposes functions that can be used as class member initializers
 * to make use of various APIs. Those are called initializer APIs.
 *
 * Signal-based inputs are relying on initializer APIs because such inputs
 * are declared using `input` and `input.required` intersection functions.
 * Similarly, signal-based queries follow the same pattern and are also
 * declared through initializer APIs.
