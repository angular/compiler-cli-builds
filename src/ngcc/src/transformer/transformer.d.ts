/**
 * A Package is stored in a directory on disk and that directory can contain one or more package formats - e.g. fesm2015, UMD, etc.
 *
 * Each of these formats exposes one or more entry points, which are source files that need to be
 * parsed to identify the decorated exported classes that need to be analyzed and compiled by one or
 * more `DecoratorHandler` objects.
 *
 * Each entry point to a package is identified by a `SourceFile` that can be passed to the
 * `getDecoratedExportedClasses()` method.

 * The actual file which needs to be transformed also depends upon the package format.
 *
 * - Flat file packages have all the classes in a single file.
 * - Other packages may re-export classes from other non-entry point files.
 * - Some formats may contain multiple "modules" in a single file.
